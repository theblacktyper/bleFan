This is a project in which a room fan (regular US outlet plug) is being controlled based on
the ambient temperature, which is measured by a temperature sensor.
Microchip PIC16F18875 microcontroller is used in this project.
In addition, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication is added to this project so that
live temperature reading can be pushed to mobile device connected via BLE.
